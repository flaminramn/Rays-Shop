        <p>Createing a static website in Azure.</p>
    <p>Why is GitHub involved with Azure Static Web Apps?

When you create a Static Web App in Azure, it’s designed to be CI/CD (Continuous Deployment) driven — meaning:

You edit code locally (in VS Code)

You push it to GitHub

GitHub Actions auto-builds & deploys your site to Azure

⚠️ If you don’t push to GitHub, Azure never sees your updates.

This model is what Azure Static Web Apps is built for.

✅ What You Want (And It Is Possible)

You want to:

Edit code in VS Code on your local machine

Save/commit those changes locally

Push changes to GitHub

Have your site auto-update in Azure

To make that work, these must be connected:

1. VS Code → GitHub

Your local project must be a Git repo linked to your GitHub repo.

2. GitHub → Azure

Your Azure Static Web App must be linked to the GitHub repo, with a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys it.</p>
