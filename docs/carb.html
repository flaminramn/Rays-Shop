        <p>This is the link to the carburetor I ordered for the snowblower. After installing it, I ran into an issue — the engine was still starving for fuel and would only run if I kept the choke on. I took the carb apart to inspect the main jet, and at first glance, it looked like it had cobwebs inside.

Even after spraying it with carb cleaner and blasting it with compressed air, the clog didn’t clear. So I brought it inside and took a closer look under my microscope. That’s when I saw several tiny, hair-like fibers stuck inside the jet. I carefully cleaned them out with a pick, reassembled everything, and after that, the snowblower ran much better.</p>
